# Licenses

Licenses for the data are different to the license used for the code and hex maps because they come from external sources.

## 2015 General Election

These [data come from the Electoral Commission](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/our-work/our-research/electoral-data). No license is stated but they are available as `.xls` and `.csv` for re-use.

## EU Referendum data

The EU Referendum did not collect votes by parliamentary constituency (apart from in some places) so there is no official values for this. However, we have used [estimates by Chris Hanretty](https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/final-estimates-of-the-leave-vote-or-areal-interpolation-and-the-uks-referendum-on-eu-membership-5490b6cab878) that are probably OK. These are published  in "[Areal interpolation and the UKâ€™s referendum on EU membership](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17457289.2017.1287081)", Chris Hanretty, Journal Of Elections, Public Opinion And Parties, Online Early Access http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17457289.2017.1287081 and in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b71SDKPFbk-ktmUTXmDpUP5PT299qq24orEA0_TOpmw/edit?usp=sharing).
